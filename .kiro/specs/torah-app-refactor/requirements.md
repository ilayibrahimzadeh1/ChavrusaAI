# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This document outlines the requirements for refactoring the existing Torah learning partner application. The current application is a single-file Node.js server with an HTML frontend that provides an AI-powered Torah study experience with different rabbi personalities integrated with the Sefaria API. The refactoring aims to create a more maintainable, stable, and professional application structure while preserving and enhancing the core functionality.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1: Application Architecture Restructuring

**User Story:** As a developer, I want a well-organized codebase with proper separation of concerns, so that the application is maintainable and scalable.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the application is restructured THEN the backend SHALL be organized into separate modules for routes, services, middleware, and configuration
2. WHEN the frontend is restructured THEN it SHALL be organized into separate files for HTML, CSS, and JavaScript with proper component separation
3. WHEN the project structure is created THEN it SHALL follow Node.js best practices with clear folder organization
4. WHEN dependencies are managed THEN they SHALL be properly categorized as production and development dependencies

### Requirement 2: Enhanced Error Handling and Stability

**User Story:** As a user, I want the application to handle errors gracefully and provide meaningful feedback, so that I have a reliable learning experience.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN an API call fails THEN the system SHALL display appropriate error messages to the user
2. WHEN the OpenAI API is unavailable THEN the system SHALL provide fallback responses or retry mechanisms
3. WHEN the Sefaria API is unavailable THEN the system SHALL handle the failure gracefully without crashing
4. WHEN invalid user input is received THEN the system SHALL validate and sanitize the input before processing
5. WHEN server errors occur THEN they SHALL be logged appropriately for debugging

### Requirement 3: Configuration Management

**User Story:** As a developer, I want proper configuration management, so that the application can be easily deployed and maintained across different environments.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the application starts THEN it SHALL load configuration from environment variables with sensible defaults
2. WHEN API keys are required THEN they SHALL be loaded securely from environment variables
3. WHEN configuration is invalid THEN the application SHALL provide clear error messages and fail to start safely
4. WHEN different environments are used THEN the configuration SHALL support development, staging, and production settings

### Requirement 4: Session Management Enhancement

**User Story:** As a user, I want my conversations to be properly managed and persisted, so that I can have meaningful ongoing discussions with the rabbis.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user starts a conversation THEN the system SHALL create a unique session with proper memory management
2. WHEN a user continues a conversation THEN the system SHALL maintain context and conversation history
3. WHEN sessions become inactive THEN they SHALL be cleaned up to prevent memory leaks
4. WHEN multiple users access the system THEN each SHALL have isolated session data

### Requirement 5: API Integration Improvements

**User Story:** As a user, I want reliable integration with external APIs, so that I can access Torah texts and AI responses consistently.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN Torah references are detected THEN the system SHALL fetch relevant texts from Sefaria API with proper error handling
2. WHEN AI responses are generated THEN they SHALL include proper context from both conversation history and Torah sources
3. WHEN API rate limits are encountered THEN the system SHALL implement appropriate backoff strategies
4. WHEN API responses are cached THEN they SHALL improve performance while respecting API terms of service

### Requirement 6: Frontend User Experience Enhancement

**User Story:** As a user, I want an intuitive and responsive interface, so that I can focus on learning rather than navigating technical issues.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the page loads THEN it SHALL display quickly with proper loading states
2. WHEN users interact with the interface THEN it SHALL provide immediate feedback and smooth transitions
3. WHEN errors occur THEN they SHALL be displayed in user-friendly language with suggested actions
4. WHEN the application is used on mobile devices THEN it SHALL be fully responsive and functional
5. WHEN users select different rabbis THEN the interface SHALL clearly indicate the current selection and personality

### Requirement 7: Documentation and Setup

**User Story:** As a developer or user, I want comprehensive documentation, so that I can understand, set up, and use the application effectively.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the project is accessed THEN it SHALL include a comprehensive README with setup instructions
2. WHEN developers want to contribute THEN they SHALL find clear development guidelines and project structure documentation
3. WHEN users want to understand the application THEN they SHALL find clear usage instructions and feature descriptions
4. WHEN the application is deployed THEN it SHALL include deployment instructions for common platforms

### Requirement 8: Code Quality and Testing Foundation

**User Story:** As a developer, I want a solid foundation for code quality and testing, so that the application can be maintained and extended reliably.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN code is written THEN it SHALL follow consistent formatting and linting standards
2. WHEN the project structure is created THEN it SHALL include configuration for testing frameworks
3. WHEN critical functions are implemented THEN they SHALL be designed to be easily testable
4. WHEN the application is built THEN it SHALL include basic health check endpoints for monitoring

### Requirement 9: Security Enhancements

**User Story:** As a user and system administrator, I want the application to be secure, so that my data and the system are protected from common vulnerabilities.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN user input is processed THEN it SHALL be properly sanitized to prevent injection attacks
2. WHEN API keys are used THEN they SHALL be stored securely and not exposed in client-side code
3. WHEN HTTP requests are made THEN appropriate security headers SHALL be set
4. WHEN sessions are managed THEN they SHALL use secure session handling practices

### Requirement 10: Performance Optimization

**User Story:** As a user, I want fast response times and efficient resource usage, so that my learning experience is smooth and uninterrupted.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN static assets are served THEN they SHALL be optimized and properly cached
2. WHEN API calls are made THEN they SHALL be optimized to minimize response times
3. WHEN the application handles multiple users THEN it SHALL manage resources efficiently
4. WHEN large responses are generated THEN they SHALL be streamed or paginated appropriately
